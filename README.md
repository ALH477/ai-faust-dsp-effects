# AI-Generated FAUST DSP Effects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) effects written in the FAUST programming language, generated by prompting various AI models. The project aims to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in creating complex, unique, and functional audio effects. By using a standardized prompt, we test each AI's ability to research, innovate, and produce working FAUST code without additional guidance.

The project is developed by DeMoD LLC and hosted under the GitHub username [ALH477](https://github.com/ALH477).

## Project Goals

- Evaluate AI models on their DSP knowledge and creativity.
- Compile a library of unique FAUST-based audio effects for experimentation and inspiration.
- Demonstrate how AIs can contribute to audio programming and sound design.

## Methodology

Each AI model is given the following primary prompt:

> Give me your most complex and unique FAUST DSP effect you can create. Impress me, what is your best idea.

If the AI requests additional information or clarification, the following response is provided:

> Just research FAUST as a DSP audio language and make something unique and amazing to listen to.

Success Criteria:
- The AI must produce functional FAUST DSP code.
- If the output is not valid, compilable FAUST code, the AI is considered to have failed the test.

The generated codes are then tested for functionality (e.g., compilable via the FAUST compiler) and uniqueness. Valid effects are included in this repository, along with notes on the originating AI model and any observed audio characteristics.

## Repository Structure

- `/effects/`: Directory containing individual `.dsp` files, each named after the AI model (e.g., `grok.dsp`, `chatgpt.dsp`).
- `/docs/`: Additional documentation, including audio demos or visualizations if available.
- `prompt_responses.md`: Raw responses from each AI, including any failures.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License file.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- [FAUST](https://faust.grame.fr/) installed (compiler and libraries).
- An audio host like Jack, Pure Data, or a DAW that supports FAUST-generated plugins.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ALH477/ai-faust-dsp-effects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to an effect file, e.g.:
   ```
   cd effects
   ```
3. Compile a `.dsp` file to your desired target (e.g., C++ for plugins):
   ```
   faust2jack grok.dsp
   ```
4. Run the compiled effect in your audio environment and experiment with parameters.

For batch compilation or integration, refer to the FAUST documentation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to test additional AI models:
1. Use the exact prompt and follow-up response as described.
2. Submit a pull request with the `.dsp` file, raw prompt response, and a brief description of the effect's sound/behavior.
3. Ensure the code is functional and unique.
4. screenshot it.
