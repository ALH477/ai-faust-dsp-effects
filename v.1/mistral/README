# Quantum Foam Granular Cloud

A complex and unique Faust DSP effect that combines granular synthesis, chaotic modulation, and quantum foam-like effects.

## Features

- **Granular Cloud Engine**: Combines delay and low-pass filtering to create a cloud-like texture.
- **Chaotic Modulation**: Uses a logistic map to introduce unpredictable modulation.
- **Quantum Foam Effect**: Adds a layer of noise modulation to create a foam-like texture.
- **Nonlinear Distortion**: Adds harmonic richness to the effect.
- **Self-Modulating Delay**: Introduces a delay network that modulates itself.
- **Flocking Algorithm**: Simulates the behavior of grains in a flock.

## Parameters

- **grainSize**: Controls the size of the grains in milliseconds.
- **feedbackAmount**: Controls the amount of feedback in the system.
- **modulationDepth**: Controls the depth of the modulation.
- **chaosAmount**: Controls the amount of chaotic modulation.
- **delayTime**: Controls the delay time in milliseconds.
- **distortionAmount**: Controls the amount of distortion.
- **quantumFoam**: Controls the amount of quantum foam modulation.
- **flocking**: Controls the behavior of the flocking algorithm.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Effect**: Use the Faust compiler to compile the effect into your preferred plugin format.
2. **Load the Plugin**: Load the compiled plugin into your DAW or audio processing software.
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the provided sliders to adjust the parameters and explore the sonic possibilities.

## About

This effect is part of a study on digital signal processing and the use of Faust for creating complex and unique audio effects. It demonstrates the use of granular synthesis, chaotic modulation, and quantum foam-like effects to create a rich and dynamic sound texture.
